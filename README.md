# Scheme-Interpreter
## What is this?
- Implementation of a LISP interpreter for a subset of the Scheme language in Python using a recursive descent parser, which requires a significant understanding of lexical and syntactic analysis as well as input parsing. 
- Won first place in the Scheme Contest of COMPSCI 61A, which was a contest about defining higher-order, recursive Scheme functions and utilizing methods translated from Python Turtle Graphics in order to create a personal artwork. According to the description of the contest, "the winner should exemplify the principles of elegance, beauty, and abstraction that are prized in the Berkeley computer science curriculum".
